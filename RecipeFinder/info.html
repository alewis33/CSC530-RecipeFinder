            <h2>Welcome to the About RecipeFinder Page</h2>
            <h3>About Recipe Finder</h3>
            <p>Recipe Finder is a web-based application that is used as a way for people to find and try new and exciting recipes.
                The user will enter their information as the first requirement, and then go through what the website has to offer.  
                The cabinet portion is up first, where people can enter in ingredients, fridge and freezer items, and cabinet items 
                into one of their cabinets.  Once this is done, the user will then use the ‘Find me a Recipe’ button, and the button 
                will then take them to google, where this search engine will enter in every item on the user’s list, and ONLY 
                produce recipes that have the ingredients that the user has listed in their cabinet.  Once they find a recipe they 
                might enjoy making, the user can add this to their cookbook.  Here, recipes can be stored for later user.  The user 
                will also have the option of having several different cookbooks and cabinets, all named what they wish to be named.
                There is also an option in the app where people can select between a variety of different dietary restrictions a 
                user might have, which can be modified in the account settings section.</p>
            <p>The reason that our team created the Recipe Finder web-based application is to help families, hard-workers, and 
                people that need to cut back on expenses to look at their cabinet and think to themselves ‘Maybe I can make 
                something from the leftovers I have in my kitchen!’  We all know that after shopping and cooking our own food for 
                an entire week that there might be leftover items that we have not used or touched yet.  We take this aspect and 
                try to turn it into a positive instead of a negative.  Instead of throwing your food away, go on our website and 
                enter in all the leftover items you have.  Then the website will try to find a recipe that fits all or just some 
                of the food items you entered into the cabinet and show a bunch of recipes you can try.  Hopefully, we can get 
                people to stop wasting their food and money, and maybe find some recipes people would never have thought to try 
                before!</p>
